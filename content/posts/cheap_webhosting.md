# Cheap Domain Web Hosting.

Since I'm lucky enough to own my own domain I need to go through the hassle of
hosting it. I used to use [a friend's webhosting
service](http://www.snowmoonsoftware.com) but with GitHub offering free static
WebHosting (which is more then enough for my needs) and Microsoft at the time I
started where offering free mail hosting I decided to switch.

This still leaves the need for two services.

1. Web Registration (I use [Hostway](http://www.hostway.com) randomly as they are cheap) and
2. Domain Name Service (DNS)

These are my notes about cheap domain name service. I decided to use
[FreeDNS][freedns]'s _premium_ service for
i[$30/year](http://freedns.afraid.org/premium/). They do offer a _free_ service
as well but that makes your domain public something I'm not interested in.
$30/year gives me one stealth domain under my control with 25 subdomains which
for my needs should be plenty. After paying I was not directly given the
ability to register my domain as a _stealth_ domain (only public and private).
Decided to hold off until Monday to see what will happen.
